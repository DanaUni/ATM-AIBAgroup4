Understanding the difference between vaccines, vaccinations, and immunizations can be tricky. Below is an easy guide that explains how these terms are used:
A vaccine is a product that produces immunity from a disease and can be administered through needle injections, by mouth, or by aerosol.
A vaccination is the injection of a killed or weakened organism that produces immunity in the body against that organism.
An immunization is the process by which a person or animal becomes protected from a disease. Vaccines cause immunization, and there are also some diseases that cause immunization after an individual recovers from the disease.
