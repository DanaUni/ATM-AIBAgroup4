How measles can change a life
In the early 1990s we lived in  Berlin, Germany. We were young and full of plans for the future. My wife Anke  was working as a nurse and I had just started my professional career as an  engineer. We became a little family when Julian, our older son, was born in the  spring of 1992. We built our â€œnestâ€?, had great friends and neighbours, and  simply enjoyed life as a young family.
As most parents probably are, we  were very grateful and thankful. Two years later, during the summer of 1994,  our second child, Maximilian, saw the light of day and made our family  happiness complete. Back then, we had not the slightest idea of how dramatically  our lives would change some years later.
Max turned out to be a blessing  and a challenge at the same time: he was so full of energy and life that it was  sometimes hard to keep him under control. But he was very charming, even as a  baby. He won the hearts of the people around him in no time.

When he got sick in the winter of  1994/1995, we were a bit worried because of his young age. After all, he was  only six months old when measles hit him badly. It had been way too early for  vaccination, but not too early for infection. He spent several days with a high  fever while his paediatrician feared that he would develop some sort of  complications. And he did: his lungs got affected, he developed a dry cough,  and sometimes he even had difficulties breathing. We were concerned, but had no  clue and nobody had ever mentioned anything about potentially fatal measles  complications.
After a few weeks everything was  over. Max had recovered and as spring came around, the vivid, high-energy boy  was back. What we did not know back then was that he would only stay with us  for another 10 years.
When Max was in third grade of  elementary school his performance in math suddenly dropped.
Initially we thought that it  might have to do with his high energy level and his difficulty concentrating  sometimes. But then he started showing some strange behaviours â€“ only for short  moments, but becoming more frequent. We did not realise that these were the  first signsâ€¦
In October of 2004 the first  seizure occurred. Max would stop doing anything â€“ from one second to the other â€“ he would sit and stare. Just for a few seconds or sometimes a minute. When  the seizure was over, he could not remember anything. We learned that this kind  of seizure is called â€˜absenceâ€™.
The doctors told us that  sometimes children would develop this kind of epilepsy when they were just  about to enter puberty. So we thought that maybe it would be temporary and  eventually go away. But there was a bad sign: Maxâ€™s EEG that was taken shortly  after his first seizure was entirely abnormal. There were curve patterns that  did not belong there. The doctors tried to control the seizures by a special  mix of anticonvulsants. And actually it did help â€“ for a few weeks.
Between December of 2004 and  February of 2005 our beloved boy seemed to be back. We thought that finally we  had everything under control and that the seizures would eventually go away. We  didnâ€™t worry about him not going to school anymore, because he couldnâ€™t keep up  with the lessons.
We ignored the fact that he could  not remember things that had just happened a few hours before.
We ignored the fact that his  behaviour became moreâ€¦We just didnâ€™t want to realise what was happening.
The seizures came back in March.  Heavy, frequent and different. The doctors sent us to one of the best epilepsy  centres in Germany at Kehl-Kork. They only needed a few examinations to confirm  the worst suspicions: Max was diagnosed with SSPE, Subacute Sclerosing  Panencephalitis, a late complication of an early age measles disease. Rare, but  fatal â€“ in any case, without exception.
It was very hard for us to  realise that they were talking about our bright, happy, vivid 10-year-old boy.
We were numb, desperate, did not  understand that the doctors were telling us that we would lose our child â€“ no  matter what, just a matter of when.
We fought hard for a long time.  We spent nights on the internet seeking for rescue, for some sort of treatment  that would stop us from going down the path of the inevitable. We established  contacts with medical scientists in India, Turkey and the US. We imported  homeopathic medicine from India; we applied ÃŸ-interferon, vitamins, fish oil,  minerals â€“ all the good stuff.
But fate sometimes is relentless:  in April of 2006 our boy said good-bye forever. An unexpected thrust of brain  inflammation put him into a vegetative state. Within only hours he lost  everything he had learned during his young life. His last words were: â€œI donâ€™t  know who you areâ€?. Itâ€™s going to haunt us for the rest of our lives.
The following years were  characterised by despair, disbelief, unrealistic hope, and many illusions, by  anger, and by a very slow process of realising that he will never come back.  But above all, there was and still is the everlasting daily struggle to somehow  survive as a family. After all, Maxâ€™s brother
Julian had just turned 12 when  our family was hit by this tragedy. Didnâ€™t at least he deserve to spend his  teenage years in an environment that provided as much normality as possible?

Today â€“ at the age of 18 â€“ Maximilian is still with us. His condition has slowly, but steadily worsened  over the years. He can no longer sit or hold his head up. After all those years  in which he could at least be fed like a baby, his chewing and swallowing  capabilities have lately ceased significantly. His body temperature regulation  is unstable; he has many seizures, unpredictable, sometimes strong, sometimes  barely noticeable. We feed him by a stomach tube and carry him around in his  wheel chair. His level of reaction to his environment varies from little to  none. When a day is exceptionally good, he would laugh at Mom or Dad, or his  brother, or his nurse when they caress him and talk to him.
Max will die. Nobody knows when  or how, but it is inevitable. And we have no idea, if and how we as a family  are going to survive thisâ€¦ But what drives us crazy is the fact that all of  this could have been avoided, had obligatory vaccination protected more  children from getting infected by measles and other dangerous â€œchildhoodâ€? diseases.
The measles virus is extremely  dangerous. Thousands of children around the world suffer from acute  complications such as heart problems, deafness, eye infection, meningitis,  hepatitis, bronchitis, Krupp cough, and of course the rare ones like infections  of the optic nerve or SSPE.
Other severe diseases such as  pox, plague, or poliomyelitis are almost eliminated on this planet, because  better hygiene and protection by vaccination has successfully pushed back those  infections.
So why donâ€™t we learn? Isnâ€™t it a  shame for a developed country like Germany that measles are still an issue?
When it comes to vaccination,  parents are not responsible for their own children only â€“ their decision pro or  against vaccination may have a significant impact on others! There are proven  cases of babies being infected by measles while sitting in a pediatricianâ€™s  waiting room. Isnâ€™t that cynical? One of these children died a year ago, from  SSPE.
Looking back and considering how  life could have been is hurtful. Max did not deserve what has happened to him.  It is almost unbearable to accept the fact that under different circumstances  or if we had lived in another country back at that time our child would most  likely still be healthy. We have lost him forever and it is breaking our  hearts. Only in our memories we still see him and he makes us smile. Sometimes  the thought of him is choking us. We do not know how long Max will still stay  with us, but we will care for him until the end.

It offers information about SSPE and its treatment and helps establishing contacts with experts, doctors and affected families around the world. Also, â€œaktion-maxâ€? offers help and networking for those families who are hit by the fate of SSPE. The associationâ€™s webpage www.aktion-max.de contains regular updates on Maximilianâ€™s situation and media links. During the past 6 years â€œaktion-maxâ€? has initiated or supported several public initiatives to educate the public about the danger of measles, their potential complications such as SSPE, and the risks of lacking childhood immunization. The family and the association are based in the greater Stuttgart area, Germany.
